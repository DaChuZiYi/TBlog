    "content": "Welcome to the Notebook open-source project, where you can be a part of a thriving community of technical writers and developers! This project utilizes GitHub’s Jekyll1 framework to create a dynamic platform for sharing technical knowledge and learning from one another. Whether you’re a beginner eager to learn or an experienced developer looking to contribute, Notebook offers a win-win opportunity for all.Getting StartedSetting up EnvironmentIt’s highly suggest to use any Linux distro (Ubuntu: highly recommended) compared to Windows. Most of the cases, you won’t face any issues while building the project within your local system if you follow the instruction below properly. But if you’re facing any issue, you can post them within the repo discussion Help Request…For Ubuntu:If you’re using a Linux distribution - Ubuntu, follow these steps:  Install Ruby and other prerequisites:    sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev -y        Avoid installing RubyGems packages (called gems) as the root user. Instead, set up a gem installation directory for your user account. The following commands will add environment variables to your ~/.bashrc file to configure the gem installation path:  echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrcecho 'export GEM_HOME=\"$HOME/gems\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrcecho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrcsource ~/.bashrc    Use the following command, to check whether Ruby has properly installed and its PATH has been set properly.    ruby -v        Finally, install Jekyll and Bundler:    gem install jekyll bundler        For Other Linux Distros, check the offical Jekyll webpage2. Also make sure, you have installed bundler along with jekyll using the follow command:  gem install bundler    Use the following command to check whether the bundler and jekyll framework installed properly or not.    bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy      For Windows:For Windows users, setting up the environment is a bit more involved:      Start by downloading and installing the the Ruby using RubyInstaller, choose the the latest one with Devkit with default options.        At the end of installation, You’ll get CMD asking you to enter option between 1-3. Enter 3 as input, then you can enter 2 if you want to update MYSYS2 but that’s totally optional. After all the installation is done, press enter to close the CMD prompt.    Use the following command, to check whether Ruby has properly installed and its PATH has been set properly.    ruby -v        Open a new command prompt window from the start menu and install Jekyll and Bundler:    gem install jekyll bundler        Use the following command to check whether the bundler and jekyll framework installed properly or not.    bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy      For MacOS:If you’re on MacOS, follow these steps:  Ensure you have the Homebrew package manager installed. If you’re facing any issues while setting up the project in MacOS, check out the Trobleshooting post within the Help Request discussion.  Install chruby and ruby-install with Homebrew:    brew install chruby ruby-install xz        Install the latest stable version of Ruby (supported by Jekyll1):    ruby-install ruby 3.1.3        This will take a few minutes, and once it’s done, configure your shell to automatically use chruby:    echo \"source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh\" &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrcecho \"source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh\" &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrcecho \"chruby ruby-3.1.3\" &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc # run 'chruby' to see actual version        If you’re using Bash, replace .zshrc with .bash_profile. If you’re not sure, read this external guide to find out which shell you’re using.  Quit and relaunch Terminal, then check that everything is working:    ruby -v        After installing Ruby with chruby, install the latest Jekyll &amp; bundler gem:    gem install bundler jekyll        Use the following command to check whether the bundler and jekyll framework installed properly or not.    bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy      Building the ProjectAfter setting up the environment, you can start contributing to the project:      Start by forking the repository.    Clone the forked repository to your local machine.    #cloning the repogit clone https://github.com/&lt;your-github-user-name&gt;/Notebook.git#entering the project directorycd Notebook        Use the following command to install project dependencies.    bundle        Host the static website locally using the following command to preview the current state of the project.    bundle exec jekyll s        Use --incremental argument to update the project live while working on it…  bundler exec jekyll s --incremental    If project build is successful, then you can view the project build that is hosted through your localhost:4000/Notebook. Well done, you have successfully setted up the project within your local system.Contribution GuidelinesTo contribute effectively, please follow these guidelines:      All of the technical writing will be done in Markdown format.
